## Inspiration
We all love background soundtracks while we work - be it lo-fi music, horror movie explanations, or podcasts. And lately, podcasts have become more than just entertainment - theyâ€™re stories, experiences, raw human emotions shared through voice. This sparked the curiosity "Can I simulate that podcast magic using AI?", and then rest is History:

## What it does
It takes any novel, site, pdf or any readable thing that you want and with it's magic turn the borning reading session into an exciting Podcast with much more refined info !! With just 3-click, the heavy page is shinked into a 5-min long Podcast with all major and relevant information.

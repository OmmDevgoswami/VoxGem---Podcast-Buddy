However, after second thought, I believe that it makes the theory irrevocably universal.

They explore the fascinating idea that every human who ever lived, and ever will live, is just a different version of the same soul – you! Prepare to question everything you thought you knew about life, the universe, and everything.\n",

            "**Alex:** Welcome back to VoxGem, where we explore the gems of knowledge hidden within the vast cosmos of thought. Today, we're cracking open a particularly intriguing concept – The Egg Theory. And to help us understand this mind-boggling idea, we have the brilliant Aria joining us. Welcome to the show, Aria!\n",
            "\n",
            "**Aria:** Thanks for having me, Alex. Excited to dive into this!\n",
            "\n",
            "**Alex:**  So, Aria, for our listeners who are hearing about this for the first time, can you give us the rundown on what The Egg Theory actually proposes?\n",
            "\n",
            "**Aria:** Absolutely.  The Egg Theory, at its core, suggests that all of humanity, past, present, and future, is actually one singular soul experiencing itself in countless different incarnations. Imagine the universe as a cosmic egg, and each individual life is just a stage in the development of that single soul within.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Alex:** Whoa. Okay, so let me get this straight. I'm Abraham Lincoln, I'm Cleopatra, I'm… that guy who cut me off in traffic this morning? (chuckles)\n",
            "\n",
            "**Aria:** (laughs) Precisely!  You've experienced life through every set of eyes that has ever existed, and every set of eyes yet to come.  The theory proposes that we are all interconnected on the deepest level, fragments of a single, evolving consciousness.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Alex:** That's… a lot to take in.  But if we're all the same soul, why don't we remember our past lives? Why do we feel so distinct and individual?\n",
            "\n",
            "**Aria:**  That's a great question, Alex.  The theory suggests that our human minds are simply too limited to grasp the entirety of our soul's experience. It's like trying to pour the ocean into a teacup.  We can only hold a tiny fraction of our total awareness in any given lifetime.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Alex:** So, all our experiences, good and bad, are essentially self-inflicted?  If I hurt someone, I'm ultimately hurting myself in another form?\n",
            "\n",
            "**Aria:** Yes, that's a key implication.  Every act of kindness, every act of cruelty, ultimately ripples back to the source – that singular consciousness. It's a powerful incentive for compassion, wouldn't you say?\n",
            "\n",
            "**Alex:** Absolutely. It really puts a new spin on the Golden Rule. (pause) But what's the ultimate goal of all this reincarnation?  Why are we going through all these different lives?\n",
            "\n",
            "**Aria:**  The Egg Theory suggests that it’s a process of growth and maturation for the soul.  With each lifetime, we gather new experiences, learn new lessons, and expand our understanding of existence.  The ultimate goal is to reach a state of complete self-awareness, to become, in a sense, god-like.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Alex:** Wow.  So, we’re all just… baby gods in training?\n",
            "\n",
            "**Aria:**  In a way, yes.  The universe, according to this theory, is a sort of incubator for the soul.  We're all developing, evolving towards a higher state of being.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Alex:** This is fascinating stuff, Aria. But I have to ask – is there any scientific evidence to support this theory, or is it purely philosophical?\n",
            "\n",
            "**Aria:** Currently, it's primarily a philosophical concept.  However, there are some intriguing parallels in quantum physics and the study of consciousness that hint at deeper interconnectedness than we traditionally understand.  Things like quantum entanglement, where seemingly separate particles are instantaneously linked, suggest a reality that's far more complex than we perceive.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Alex:** So, even if it’s not scientifically proven, the Egg Theory offers a profound perspective on our place in the universe.  It challenges us to think about our relationships with others, with ourselves, and with the very fabric of reality.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Aria:**  Exactly. It encourages empathy, compassion, and a sense of shared destiny. Whether or not you fully believe it, the Egg Theory provides a powerful framework for understanding the interconnectedness of all things.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "**Alex:** Absolutely. This has been a truly mind-expanding conversation, Aria. Thank you so much for sharing your insights with us today.\n",

            "**Aria:** My pleasure, Alex.  Thanks for having me.\n",
